# About MetaR

This project aims to synthesise the impact of global environmental change on a key physiological trait in ectotherms: their metabolic rate. To this end, I will assemble and curate a large, intra-and-interspecific database on metabolic rates of ectotherms (invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles), globally distributed across realms (marine, freshwater, intertidal and terrestrial), climate zones (polar, temperature and tropical), and from the deepest ocean to the highest mountains.

**MetaR** is a global database of 1,577 sampling locations spanning marine, intertidal, freshwater and terrestrial realms, from depths of 4,420 m to elevations above sea level of 4,300 m. MetaR will include information from more than 1800 primary articles, published over more than a century (from 1914 to 2022).

**MetaR** includes data over 2,400 species across 16 phyla, ranging from aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates.
