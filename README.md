# About MetaR

This project aims to synthesise the impact of global environmental change on a key physiological trait in ectotherms: their metabolic rate. To this end, I will assemble and curate a large, intra-and-interspecific database on metabolic rates of ectotherms (invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles), globally distributed across realms (marine, freshwater, intertidal and terrestrial), climate zones (polar, temperature and tropical), and from the deepest ocean to the highest mountains.

**MetaR** is a global database of 3,192 sampling locations spanning marine, intertidal, freshwater and terrestrial realms, from depths of 4,420 m to elevations above sea level of 4,300 m. MetaR will include information from more than 2,000 primary articles, published over more than a century (from 1914 to 2022).

**MetaR** includes data over 2000 species across 14 Phyla, 55 Classes, 248 Orders and 800 families, ranging from aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates. I have already established a dataset from 1720 primary references with more than 90,000 records on inter-and intraspecific metabolic rates. MetaR also provides metadata relating to the methodology  of each record.
