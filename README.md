# About MetaR

This project aims to synthesise the impact of global environmental change on a key physiological trait in ectotherms: their metabolic rate. To this end, I will assemble and curate a large, intra-and-interspecific database on metabolic rates of ectotherms (invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles), globally distributed across realms (marine, freshwater, intertidal and terrestrial), climate zones (polar, temperature and tropical), and from the deepest ocean to the highest mountains.

Using ectotherms as a model system, the objectives of this project are:
1.	To quantify the variability of metabolic rate concerning major biological, functional and ecological traits and phylogeny.
2.	To explore the evolutionary patterns in the relationship between metabolic rates and other relevant biological traits in addition to body mass.
3.	To determine whether metabolic variability can be used to predict geographic range shifts across realms and climatic zones.

**MetaR** is a global database of 3,192 sampling locations spanning marine, intertidal, freshwater and terrestrial realms, from depths of 4,420 m to elevations above sea level of 4,300 m. MetaR will include information from more than 2,000 primary articles, published over more than a century (from 1914 to 2022).

**MetaR** includes data from 2,647 species across 18 Phyla, 55 Classes, 248 Orders and 800 families, ranging from aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates. I have already established a dataset from 920 primary references with more than 50,000 records on inter-and intraspecific metabolic rates. MetaR also provides metadata relating to methodology  of each record.

**MetaR** will shed light on the evolution of the use and transformation of energy across ectotherms living in different realms and will allow us to answer research questions such as: 

- What drives variation in ectotherm metabolic rates across different realms and   climate zones?
- Are evolutionary rates of metabolic rates linked to cell size? 
- Can the metabolic variability of a species predict its geographic range shifts? If yes, do they differ across terrestrial and aquatic realms?
