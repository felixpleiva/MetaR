# About MetaR
 
**MetaR** is my postdoctoral project funded by the [Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/) through the [Humboldt Research Fellowship](https://www.humboldt-foundation.de/en/apply/sponsorship-programmes/humboldt-research-fellowship) to pursue research at [AWI](https://www.awi.de/en/) together with [Felix C Mark](https://www.awi.de/en/about-us/organisation/staff/single-view/felix-christopher-mark.html).

## Summary of MetaR

The whole-organism metabolic rate is a key functional trait in ecology and evolution for understanding ectotherm responses to ongoing environmental change. It is the interplay through which animals interact with their environment. Metabolic rate is also useful for predicting ecological processes at the level of organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems. The metabolic rate is strongly related to body size and environmental temperature. While much of the variation is explained by these two parameters, a considerable variation remains unexplained. Lack of standard research practices, data sparsity and insufficient coverage of various taxa limit our meaningful synthesis capacity across the tree of life, realms and climatic zones. We propose to synthesise the impact of global environmental change on a key physiological trait in ectotherms: their metabolic rate. By synthesising and curating data on metabolic rates from literature, I will assemble a large, intra-and-interspecific database on metabolic rates of ectotherms (invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles) (i) to quantify the variability of metabolic rates concerning major biological, functional and ecological traits, (ii) to explore the evolutionary patterns in the relationship between metabolic rates and other relevant biological traits in addition to body mass and (iii) to determine whether metabolic variability can be used to predict geographic range shifts across realms and climatic zones. This work will further our understanding of how we can better predict the functional consequences of global environmental change from a metabolic perspective across aquatic and terrestrial realms and climatic zones.

## State of the art and theoretical context

Initiatives developed for centralising and standardising the large body of literature on functional traits offer a great potential to achieve a broader understanding of ecological and evolutionary mechanisms occurring in nature. A key functional trait in ecology and evolution for understanding ectotherm responses to the ongoing environmental change is the whole-organism metabolic rate. It is defined as the sum of all chemical, biological and physical reactions occurring in an organism, with important fitness implications for organisms and demography. It governs the pace of life on Earth at which each organism process energy and materials to grow, reproduce, live and move. Using this fundamental trait is possible to predict most observed ecological processes at the level of organisms, populations, communities and ecosystems [1].

Body size and temperature are core parameters of the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), which predicts that metabolic rate does not increase in direct proportion to body size but instead scales with an exponent of around 0.75 [1]. While numerous studies have traditionally focused on scaling the relationship between an organism’s body mass and metabolic rate [2], the universality of the MTE scaling exponent is still extensively debated. Much of this debate suggests the scaling exponent varying as a function of temperature both within and among species and across phylogeny. Undoubtedly, variation in metabolic rate is due to changes in body mass and temperature. However, even after accounting for these two parameters, a considerable amount of variation remains unexplained. Some species can still vary 10-fold in metabolic rate. Perhaps, the next step is to explore which other traits, together with body size and temperature, can explain this variation in metabolism [3]. Reconciling the different views of this debate is a serious scientific challenge. It has been exacerbated both by the lack of standard research practices, resulting in methodological differences among studies [4], data sparsity, and by insufficient coverage of metabolic data across the tree of life, which is limiting a meaningful synthesis. 

To further understand the evolutionary causes of metabolic rates variation, it is possible to link this variation with other biological attributes inherent in the species. One particular trait that may explain the variation of metabolic rate is cell size. Because cells are universality the primary building compartments of all organisms, and cell size is a common feature that can be compared across all organisms, its effect on supply and demand of resources should influence metabolic rate. An alternative theoretical framework explaining the variation observed in the scaling exponents is related to the wasteful and frugal strategy [5], which puts the cell size in the foreground as an essential driver to explain evolutionary processes in the animal kingdom. Although the effects of cell size seem irrelevant in endotherms, recent experimental evidence in fish supports the idea that cell size becomes relevant for maintaining organismal performance under thermal challenges.

Synthesising and interpreting the diversity of metabolic patterns among species, realms, and climatic zones is important to understand the underlying drivers of change and their evolutionary causes for making realistic predictions of geographical range shifts under climate change. Because metabolic rate is tightly linked to environmental conditions, it can be used to predict responses to ongoing and future climate change scenarios. Geographical range shifts are among the most common biological responses to climate change. In the marine realm, species are shifting their ranges twice faster than the terrestrial realm, and the stronger effects of environmental temperature in marine realms suggests that one of the causes could be that aquatic species are better at tracking environmental temperature than terrestrial ones. Animals can respond to change via plasticity (how plastic is metabolic rate) or via evolution (how easy is it for different lineages to evolve different thermal reaction norms). These different responses among organisms from different realms may be governed by differences in physiology, particularly the metabolic rate.

## Aims, objectives and research questions
This project aims to synthesise the impact of global environmental change on a key physiological trait in ectotherms: their metabolic rate. To this end, I will assemble and curate a large, intra-and-interspecific database on metabolic rates of ectotherms (invertebrates, fish, amphibians and reptiles), globally distributed across realms (marine, freshwater, intertidal and terrestrial), climate zones (polar, temperature and tropical), and from the deepest ocean to the highest mountains.

Using ectotherms as a model system, the objectives of this project are:
1.	To quantify the variability of metabolic rate concerning major biological, functional and ecological traits and phylogeny.
2.	To explore the evolutionary patterns in the relationship between metabolic rates and other relevant biological traits in addition to body mass.
3.	To determine whether metabolic variability can be used to predict geographic range shifts across realms and climatic zones.

**MetaR** is a global database of 3,192 sampling locations spanning marine, intertidal, freshwater and terrestrial realms, from depths of 4,420 m to elevations above sea level of 4,300 m. MetaR will include information from more than 2,000 primary articles, published over more than a century (from 1914 to 2022).

**MetaR** includes data from 2,647 species across 18 Phyla, 55 Classes, 248 Orders and 800 families, ranging from aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates to small and large vertebrates. I have already established a dataset from 810 primary references with about 37,000 records on inter-and intraspecific metabolic rates. MetaR also provides metadata relating to methodology  of each record.

**MetaR** will shed light on the evolution of the use and transformation of energy across ectotherms living in different realms and will allow us to answer research questions such as: 

- What drives variation in ectotherm metabolic rates across different realms and   climate zones?
- Are evolutionary rates of metabolic rates linked to cell size? 
- Can the metabolic variability of a species predict its geographic range shifts? If yes, do they differ across between terrestrial and aquatic?
